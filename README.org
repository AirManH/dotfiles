*** What is layer

A /layer/ corresponds to a folder that contains a =install.sh= in its root
directory.
Each =install.sh= will be executed, and should manage and install dotfiles in
its folder.

*** How to add a new layer

1. Create a new folder (such as =hello=) inside this repo.
   And change directory to the new folder (=cd hello=).
2. Create the =install.sh=.
   For example: =echo "echo hello" > install.sh=
3. Add the new =hello= layer to the [[./install.sh][root install.sh]].
   For example:
   #+begin_src bash
layers=(
    ...
    "hello"
)
   #+end_src
