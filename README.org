- Modular organization

** Quick Start

#+begin_src sh
git clone {this repo}
cd path/to/this/repo
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
#+end_src

** Usage

*** What is layer

A /layer/ corresponds to a folder that contains a =install.sh= in its root directory.
The =install.sh= will manage and install dotfiles in its folder.

*** Add a new layer

1. Create a new folder (such as =hello=) inside this repo.
   And change directory to the new folder (=cd hello=).
2. Create the =install.sh=.
   For example: =echo "echo hello" > install.sh=
3. Add the new =hello/install.sh= to the [[root install.sh][./install.sh]].
   For example: =echo 'echo ${cur_src_dir}/hello/install.sh' >> ${path/to/this/repo}/install.sh=
